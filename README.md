# ESG Responsibility Report Platform

## Overview

This project delivers a system that supports organizations in preparing ESG responsibility reports in a structured, controlled, and auditable way.

The platform treats the ESG report as a management and compliance artifact, not as a marketing document. Its primary role is to organize data, ownership, assumptions, and decision-making across the organization, even when data is incomplete.

The system is designed to support both simplified reporting for SMEs and extended reporting aligned with CSRD requirements.

## Problem Statement

Preparing an ESG report is often fragmented across departments, based on incomplete or inconsistent data, difficult to defend during audits or client reviews, and costly to recreate every year.

This platform addresses these issues by turning ESG reporting into a repeatable business process with clear responsibility, traceability, and transparency.

## Project Goals

The main goals of the system are to enable consistent ESG reporting across reporting periods, reduce organizational and coordination cost, clearly separate facts from declarations and plans, make assumptions and gaps explicit, provide an auditable trail for disclosures, and support future regulatory requirements.

## Core Capabilities

The platform supports the full ESG reporting lifecycle including definition of reporting scope, configuration of report structure, collection and validation of data, ownership assignment, completeness tracking, documentation of assumptions, and generation of final reports.

Each report element has a defined status, source, owner, and classification.

## ESG Coverage

The system covers Environmental, Social, and Governance areas and can be mapped to CSRD/ESRS standards or used in a simplified SME mode.

## Transparency and Auditability

For each part of the report, the system records data sources, assumptions, missing data, responsible persons, and change history, enabling defensible and auditable reporting.

## Target Users

The platform is designed for management boards, ESG advisors, compliance teams, finance and HR departments, and external consultants.

## Documentation Approach

The project uses structured documentation including PRD, Architecture docs, ADRs, and epics with user stories to ensure traceability.

## Project Status

The project is in the discovery and architecture definition phase.

## Next Steps

Next steps include finalizing MVP scope, validating report structures, preparing backlog, and starting iterative development.
